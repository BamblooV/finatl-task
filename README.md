## About work

Lack of time and skill led to the fact that I gradually began to lose control over the code and it turned into what it turned into

The design was kept simple.

There are several bugs due to the fact that I took a component library that I did not work with.

Some tasks explicitly require you to use a link instead of a button. There was no separate link in the component library, but there was an option to [turn a button into a link](https://primeng.org/button#link). I didnâ€™t want to do something of my own, so I took it. Essentially, we need a link to create a11y. I hope that the creators of the component library took care of this. Please do not deduct points for this.
